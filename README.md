# Knowledge

This repository is a collection of commands, programming pieces or general concepts that I found myself Googling again and again, keeping them as random notes in Notion or Evernote or just plain markers in my browser.

One day, I got tired of that storage method so I decided to build something shareable. At the time, I was fiddling with Next.js so I decided to give it a try and this webpage is the result of that.

You can check the result at [https://knowledge.pablopugaperalta.com](https://knowledge.pablopugaperalta.com)
